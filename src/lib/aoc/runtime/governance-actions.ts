/**
 * Canonical governance action mappings for PMFreak.
 *
 * Single source of truth for:
 *   - Permission → GovernanceAction mapping (replaces local copies in access-guards, agent-access, server-authorization)
 *   - CapabilityPermission → GovernanceAction mapping (used by capability-flow)
 *   - SDK route → GovernanceAction constants (used by SDK API routes)
 *
 * Routes must import from here instead of defining semantics locally.
 * Adding a mapping here does NOT register a new runtime action — GovernanceAction is
 * defined by @aoc-enterprise/runtime and must already exist in GOVERNANCE_POLICY_REGISTRY.
